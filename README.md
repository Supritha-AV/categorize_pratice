3. Sales Performance Analysis: The analysis identifies whether sales targets are being met and highlights regions that show significant disparities.
## Tools Used:
1. Excel: VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Data Sorting, and Analysis Functions
## Steps Taken:
1. Data Import and Categorization: Data sets were imported and organized using the VLOOKUP function to link various tables.
2. Pivot Table Creation: Pivot Tables were created to summarize the sales data by region, target, and performance.
3. Disparity Analysis: Focus was placed on identifying regions where sales targets were either underachieved or exceeded.
